# SmartStudy â€“ AI-driven study planner

Final project for the Building AI course

## Summary

SmartStudy is an AI assistant that helps students create personalized study plans based on their deadlines, workload and available time.  
Building AI course project

## Background

Many students struggle with planning their studies, especially when taking multiple courses. This often leads to missed deadlines, stress and burnout. A tool like SmartStudy could improve both performance and well-being.

* difficulty prioritizing assignments  
* lack of structured study schedule  
* increased stress and inefficiency  

## How is it used?

Students input their course details, deadlines and available study time. The AI generates a realistic day-by-day plan. It can be updated if something changes. The solution is useful for university and high school students, especially those studying independently or online.

This is how you create code examples:
```
def main():
   countries = ['Denmark', 'Finland', 'Iceland', 'Norway', 'Sweden']
   pop = [5615000, 5439000, 324000, 5080000, 9609000]   # not actually needed in this exercise...
   fishers = [1891, 2652, 3800, 11611, 1757]

   totPop = sum(pop)
   totFish = sum(fishers)

   # write your solution here

   for i in range(len(countries)):
      print("%s %.2f%%" % (countries[i], 100.0))    # current just prints 100%

main()
```

## Data sources and AI methods

The project uses self-reported user input (deadlines, time availability, topics). It could apply rule-based planning and basic optimization algorithms, with potential to expand to reinforcement learning for dynamic adjustment.

| Data source        | Use case                      |
|--------------------|-------------------------------|
| User input         | Task deadlines and workload    |
| Scheduling logic   | Generate optimized study plan  |

## Challenges

The project does not solve motivational issues or guarantee task completion. It relies on users providing accurate information. Ethically, it must avoid overloading users or promoting unrealistic schedules.

## What next?

The project could evolve into a mobile app with notifications and adaptive learning based on user behavior. Collaboration with students and UX designers would help refine the tool.
